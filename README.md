### Improvements done in this iteration:

- Gamecard:
    - The feedback suggested that the placeholder-div on the GameCard made the experience worse as they thought the images simply did not load or that not every game had an image connected to it. To fix this, I simply removed the placeholder-div. 
    - A feedback stated that some users might not be familiar with the icons and their intended use and that the icons might be too small. I therefore added text to make it easier to understand the meaning and make the element easier to click on. 
    - Since games with the same name but on different platforms appear as different elements, some users thought there was a bug when multiple games of the same title appeared. To minimize this confusion, the subheader now includes the platform. 
    - A colorblind user  stated that the heart-icon's color was not too different when they liked/unliked a game. The heart-icon's color is therefore lighter in the unliked state and darker in the liked state. 
    - The blue-color on the information-icon and the color of the GameCard in dark-mode was not in line with the WCAG guidelines. The icon (and the addded text) is changed to the default text-color in light mode with a grey background upon hovering to imitate the heart-icon. In dark mode, the text is still the default for dark mode and changes to the default for light mode with the same gray background upon hovering. This is done to make it clear for the user where they can click in both light and dark mode. 

- SideBar:
    - The feedback suggested that the the sidebar was less than intuitive. The first issue was that the sidebar-icon was seen as too small. The second was that a user had to click on the icon or text to move to another page, but this was not communicated clearly. The last was thet the sidebar did not retract as the user clicked outside of the sidebar. To make it more accessible, I switched the sidebar with a navbar. The navbar is located directly underneath the header (and can therefore be seen as an extenstion of the header). The navbar also shows which page the user is on by having a different color. 

- Search:
    - Some users didn't realize that the search is case sensitive and spent extra time trying to search with no luck. To make this clear to the user, I added *"NB! Case sensitive"* to the placeholder.
    - To make the user experience even easier, I added onChange to the Search. By doing this and removing the button, I eliminated one extra step in the search sequence.

- Header
    - To make sure the website was accessible, I checked [this website](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/employers/creating-a-dyslexia-friendly-workplace/dyslexia-friendly-style-guide) which also stated a busy background could make it harder for dyslexic people to read. I therefore changed it to a solid color. 

- ModeToggleButton
    - Some feedback suggested the ModeToggleButton was not noticable enough. To fix this, I changed the color for greater contrast to the header and made the icon bigger. 

- Lesser/other changes
    - Removed reload-button as it caused more trouble rather than fixing the problem. 
    - Changed the font to Arial to make it more accessible as it is one of the dyslexic-friendly fonts (and more sustainable as it is not imported)


## Original documentation

### ðŸ˜ƒ Members

Originally developed by:

- Martine MansÃ¥ker
- Emma Pedersen
- Sindre Eidskrem
- Hang Celin Le


### :computer: Tech stack

The application is built using the GRAND-Stack, Recoil and some elements from [MUI](https://mui.com/).

#### Backend

- GraphQL
    - The group uses GraphQL to query the database. 
- Apollo server
    - The Apollo server is used to connected to the database. The Apollo server also has the great feature of automatically creating queries defined from the typeDefs. The group used these queries throughout the whole development. 
- Neo4j Database
    - The Neo4j Database is a graph database. This means all the nodes are connected to each other through relationships. This makes for faster seraches which is more sustainable in the long run. Another great advantage of using the Neo4j database was that the group didn't need to create resolvers. The dataset is added to the database through the use of the Cypher query language. 

#### Frontend

- React Typescript
    - React Typescript is used to develop this application per the requirements. 
- Apollo client 
    - Apollo client is used to retrieve and modify the data from the database. This is mainly done through *"useState"*. The group discovered the *"Apollo Sandbox"* to be a great way of getting a better understanding of the queries. By using the sandbox, the group was able to easily create and test queries. 
- Recoil
    - Recoil is used as the global state manager which keeps track the user's choice of theme. 

### :arrow_forward: Running the application

- `npm install` (in both backend and frontend)

- cd into backend and start the Apollo server with the command `node index.js`

- cd into frontend and start the React application by typing `npm start` 

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will reload on edits.

#### To run the tests:

- cd into frontend

- Run `npm test` to test the application.

- Run `npm run cypress:open` to run the end-to-end tests. 


### :page_with_curl: Content and functionality

#### Content

When starting the application, the user will be directed to the default page, which is the *"Home"*-page. 
This page consists of a searchbar, three filter options, a sort option and eight game cards (which is the group's chosen way of presenting the data) with information. The user can also see what they searched for in a separate section.

At the upper left corner is an icon which will make the sidebar visible to the user. The bar contains the different pages of the application. The user can close the sidebar by clicking the same icon.

The *"Favorite"*-page looks similar to the *Home*-page. This page stores all the games the user has favorited. If the user has not favorited any games, a simple text is visible. All the favorited games will be visible here, and the group can add filter options, search options and pagination for further improvement. The page has also a button labeled *"Reload"*, which will reload the site. This is due to the fact that the favorization (or defavorization) of a game will not automatically reload the page. This is a concious decision of the group, made to save possible reloads of the page (and re-querying) in order to adhere to good sustaiability practises.

The *"About"*-page consists of simple information about the application. 

####  Functionality

The main functionality is the search function. The user can choose which games they want too view. This can be done by searching for a game at the search field and clicking the button labeled *"Search"*. Notice that the functionality is case sensitive, meaning lowecase lettering will not result in an item with uppercase letters. 

For further precision, the user can filter by *Publisher*, *Platform* or *Genre*. The filters are applied when clicking the button labeled *"Filter"*. The user does not have to search before filtering. The user can also sort the game cards by pressing the dropdown labeled *"Sort by"*, where one can sort the games ascending or descending (alphabetically). The default sorting is set to ascending. If the filtering or searching results in no games, the user will be informed by a simple text. A known bug, which we decided to abandon in dialogue with student assistants, is the fact that if the user first filters and chooses a sorting, and then wants to sort differently on the same result set, the results will not update. In other words, the user must change one of the filter options to make a new sorting.

The application implements pagination. The user can scroll to the bottom and click on a button labeled *"Load more..."* which will make eight more cards visible for the user. This process can be repeated until the user is satisfied or there are no more games to load. 

The game cards display the title and publisher of the game. The user can click on an icon on the bottom right of the card which will make a pop up appear and reveal more informationa about the game. 

On the bottom left is a heart icon. The game is favorited when the user clicks it, which is communicated through a color change. 

The user can navigate to other pages by use of the sidebar. When viewing the sidebar, the user can click on one of the tabs which will redirect them to the desired page. 

To switch theme of the page, the user can click on the grey moon icon on the upper right corner located on the header. This icon will toggle between light and dark mode, and swtiches to a white sun on dark mode. The group followed a [guide](https://dev.to/skinnypetethegiraffe/lightdark-mode-toggle-using-mui-and-recoil-ts-3bj0), and did some modifications to make it fit for application. 

### :wrench: Technical requirements

The application retrieves data from a csv file found at [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales?resource=download). The data consist of 16 598 games with information about their publisher, platform, genre release year and sales in different areas. This data is added to a Neo4j database which is connected to an Apollo server. The data is retrieved to the frontend by the use of GraphQL. 
 
The group used Recoil to implement theme switching with light and dark modes. This covers the requirement to use some external state managment. The group found that the app didn't require any of global state managment so a decision was made to implement dark/ligth-themes solely in order to satisfy this requirement.

Most of the components, expect for the buttons, are MUI components, as the group saw it appropiate to use this component library.

The solution has a responsive web design. Layout, scaling and interaction posibilities are adaptable based on what type of device and screen size. By using CSS flexboxes, all the elements and their contents are visible and available for the user to see and interact with.

## :gear: Testing

Testing is partly done by explorative testing done by members of the group and fellow students. This is done by giving the students prompts or letting them explore by themselves. The group pmembers then took notes of where the students had problems understanding or when an unexpected bug appeared. The project also consists of 2 unit tests and an end-to-end test. All the test files are allocated in the same folder as the component/file that is being tested. In such a manner, the components being tested are close to the test and the imports are kept short. 

The unit tests have been created using Jest and React's testing library. For example does the unit test GameCard.test.tsx render a GameCard component using mockdata and checks wheter or not the mockdata is displayed in the rendered card. Further it tests that the expand button in the card works and that information is both shown and hidden again when pressing the expand button. The unit test Header.test.tsx makes use of a snapshot to check that the Header component is rendered as expected. 

The end-to-end test is implemented using Cypress. The test mimics a user's journey through the application. This is done through testing all the main functionality (see above), except visiting the *About*-page.

In testing the user interface and responsive design, the group has used the device emaluation in the web browser to simulate the application on different phone screens (vertically and horizontally) and ordinary PCs (big screen) as well as IPads (medium screen).

## :earth_africa: Universal accessebility

To adhere to universal accessebility, the application has gone through a color change from lighter to darker colors. Such change makes the constrast between text and background greater, which passes all the tests according to the WCAG guidelines. The placeholders in the input fields does not pass these tests, but this is not changed due to being the default from MUI. The fonts used on the website are easy to read, with no extra distractions. The text is also easily readable, and the group has chosen not to implement a manual font size change due to most web browsers already having this functionality implemented (which is tested to work on our application in Chrome). The buttons also adhere to universal accessability as they change both color and cursor upon hovering, which signals the change to the user. 

## :pushpin: Improvements for next time:

- Make the query case insensitive. Graphql does not have native support for this. It could be implemented with the help of Neo4j 'Search index', but the group found themselves short of time and decided to drop this feature.
- Make the sidebar remove itself when clicking outside of it. As of now the user must click the 'close' button to go back to the homepage
- Fix known bug/shortcoming of having to change one ore more filters in order to change the sorting from ascending to descending, or vice versa.
- Exclude the filter button entirely, and rather apply new filters as selection changes
